## FAQ

### How do you make money?

I don't.  I made this app for myself and want others to benefit it they want.

### How do I ensure that your app doesn't store my credentials?

The source code is available in this repository.  The app has no server.  It is stored statically on GitHub pages.  You can hash the html on the public website and compare it to the hash of the code.
